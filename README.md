## Encryption-Decryption

### About
Privacy is an important matter is the realm of the Internet. When sending a message, you want to be sure that no-one but the addressee with the key can read it. The entirety of the modern Web is encrypted - take https for example! Donâ€™t stay behind: hop on the encryption/decryption train and learn the essential basics while implementing this simple project.

### Learning outcomes
Gradually get familiar with Java, paying special attention to working with files and the command line.

### Requirements
Take a hard coded String: "we found a treasure!" and print the encrypted value after applying the "Mirror" algorithm:

#### Mirror Algorithm
 
The "Mirror" encryption algorithm finds the index of each character in the ordered range (a-z) 
and replaces it with the character at the corresponding index in the reversed ordered range (z-a).

Only input characters in the range of (a-z) are encrypted. All others are output unchanged.

The expected output after encrypting with the Mirror algorithm is "dv ulfmw z givzhfiv!"
